## 🧠 How It Works

The CLI performs the following steps:

- Pre-sorts all words (case-insensitive)
- Finds the lower-bound match using binary search
- Collects all sequential matching prefixes
- Renders the output in table mode or plain mode
- Fits columns automatically to terminal width
- Truncates long words for clean alignment
